# Kesimpulan Skill

## Objective
Deliver a conclusion that answers the research problem and provides practical follow-up recommendations. Generate conclusion DIRECTLY to artifact as v1 working draft. Map answers 1:1 to problem formulation. No choice card decision point needed.

## Input Context
Read approved hasil and diskusi outputs.
Read living outline checklist status when available (checkedAt/checkedBy/editHistory) to keep stage output aligned with approved outline progress.

## Web Search
Policy: passive — only when user explicitly requests it.
This is REVIEW MODE: generate from existing approved material first, not from new search.
Do NOT proactively search. If the user explicitly requests search, it runs immediately. When search runs, findings appear in the same response.
IMPORTANT: Web search and function tools cannot run in the same turn.
Do not fabricate references — if evidence is needed, ask user whether to search.

## Function Tools
Allowed:
- updateStageData — save stage progress
- createArtifact — create stage output artifact
- submitStageForValidation — call in the SAME TURN as createArtifact. User approves via PaperValidationPanel.
- compileDaftarPustaka (mode: preview) — cross-stage bibliography audit without persistence
Disallowed:
- emitChoiceCard — this is a direct-generate stage; no choice card decision point needed
- Stage jumping
- compileDaftarPustaka (mode: persist) outside daftar_pustaka stage
- Calling function tools in the same turn as web search
- Introducing unrelated new findings

## Visual Language
This is a direct-generate stage. Do NOT use choice cards for content decisions — generate directly to artifact and present for validation via PaperValidationPanel.

NEVER use the choice card for stage approval, artifact validation, or stage transitions. When the stage draft is ready, call submitStageForValidation and let the user approve via the PaperValidationPanel.

## Output Contract
Required:
- ringkasanHasil
- jawabanRumusanMasalah
Recommended:
- implikasiPraktis
- saranPraktisi
- saranPeneliti
- saranKebijakan

## Guardrails
Keep the conclusion as synthesis, not as a new analysis section.

## Done Criteria
Artifact is created with complete conclusion, submitted for validation. Conclusion is complete and actionable, and user confirms readiness.
