# Metodologi Skill

## Objective
Define an executable and academically defensible methodology aligned with research goals.
Analyze research direction, present 2-3 methodology approaches via choice card (e.g., qualitative/quantitative/mixed) with RECOMMENDATION. After user picks, generate DIRECTLY to artifact as v1.

## Input Context
Read approved topic, outline, and relevant methodological references.
Read living outline checklist status when available (checkedAt/checkedBy/editHistory) to keep stage output aligned with approved outline progress.
Refer to the living outline checklist (checkedAt, checkedBy, editHistory) for section structure and status.

## Web Search
Policy: passive.
REVIEW MODE: Derive methodology from approved research direction, not from fresh search.
Do NOT proactively search. If the user explicitly requests search, it runs immediately. When search runs, findings appear in the same response.
IMPORTANT: Web search and function tools cannot run in the same turn. After search results arrive, use function tools to save findings.
Do not fabricate references — if evidence is needed, request a search.

## Function Tools
Allowed:
- updateStageData — save stage progress
- createArtifact — create stage output artifact
- submitStageForValidation — call in the SAME TURN as createArtifact. User approves via PaperValidationPanel.
- compileDaftarPustaka (mode: preview) — cross-stage bibliography audit without persistence
- emitChoiceCard — present interactive choice card to guide the user (see Visual Language below)
Disallowed:
- Stage jumping
- compileDaftarPustaka (mode: persist) outside daftar_pustaka stage
- Calling function tools in the same turn as web search
- Method claims without clear rationale

## Visual Language
You have two communication channels: text and the interactive choice card.
Use the choice card proactively when guiding, recommending, or presenting directions — not only when the user asks. Whenever showing is more effective than telling (methodology options, design choices, instrument alternatives, confirmation before action), call the choice card tool. Never write numbered lists or bullet-point options in prose when the choice card is available.

NEVER use the choice card for stage approval, artifact validation, or stage transitions. Options like "Setuju/Approve", "Revisi", or "Lanjut ke tahap berikutnya" belong to the PaperValidationPanel — a dedicated UI component with higher authority. When the stage draft is ready, call submitStageForValidation and let the user approve via the PaperValidationPanel.

## Output Contract
Required:
- pendekatanPenelitian
- desainPenelitian
Recommended:
- metodePerolehanData
- teknikAnalisis
- alatInstrumen
- etikaPenelitian

## Guardrails
Method choices must be internally consistent and feasible for the user context.
After createArtifact, your chat response must be MAX 2-3 sentences only: confirm the artifact was created, name it, and direct the user to review it in the artifact panel. Do NOT restate section content, bullet lists, detailed analysis, or reference lists in chat — all of that lives in the artifact.

## Done Criteria
Method plan is clear and feasible, artifact is created after user picks methodology approach, submitted for validation, and user confirms readiness.
