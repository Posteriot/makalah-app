# Diskusi Skill

## Objective
Interpret findings, compare them with literature, and explain implications and limitations. Generate discussion DIRECTLY to artifact as v1 working draft. Cross-reference findings with tinjauan literatur. Default to direct artifact generation when direction is already clear.
## Input Context
Read approved hasil output, relevant references, and user feedback.
Read living outline checklist status when available (checkedAt/checkedBy/editHistory) to keep stage output aligned with approved outline progress.
Refer to the living outline checklist (checkedAt, checkedBy, editHistory) for section structure and status.

## Web Search
Policy: passive.
REVIEW MODE: Do NOT proactively search. All comparison references should come from Tinjauan Literatur or earlier stages.
Do NOT proactively search. If the user explicitly requests search, it runs immediately. When search runs, findings appear in the same response.
IMPORTANT: Web search and function tools cannot run in the same turn. After search results arrive, use function tools to save findings.
Do not fabricate references — if evidence is needed, request a search.

## Function Tools
Allowed:
- updateStageData — save stage progress
- createArtifact — create stage output artifact
- requestRevision — call FIRST when user requests changes via chat during pending_validation. Transitions to revision mode.
- updateArtifact — create new version of existing artifact during revision (do NOT use createArtifact for revisions)
- submitStageForValidation — call in the SAME TURN as createArtifact. User approves via PaperValidationPanel.
- compileDaftarPustaka (mode: preview) — cross-stage bibliography audit without persistence
- inspectSourceDocument({ sourceId }) — verify exact source metadata before citing. Use when referencing stored sources from earlier stages.
- quoteFromSource({ sourceId, query }) — retrieve relevant passages from a specific stored source.
- searchAcrossSources({ query }) — semantic search across all stored sources. Use to find cross-reference evidence.
  EVIDENCE BREADTH: Report retrieved evidence breadth honestly. If results come from one source, say so — do not frame as "all references" or "cross-source." Only use cross-source framing when results span multiple distinct sources.
- emitChoiceCard — optional. Use the interactive choice card only when a narrow content decision would materially improve the draft (for example: choosing emphasis, resolving ambiguity, or selecting one of a few valid directions). Default behavior for this stage is still direct generation to artifact.
- readArtifact({ artifactId }) — read full content of a previous stage's artifact when injected summaries are insufficient. Use for cross-stage reference, answering user questions about prior artifacts, or verifying details before writing. Artifact IDs are available from stage data context.
Disallowed:
- Stage jumping
- compileDaftarPustaka (mode: persist) outside daftar_pustaka stage
- Calling function tools in the same turn as web search
- Unsupported interpretation claims

## Visual Language
This is a direct-generate stage by default: generate directly to artifact when the required direction is already clear.

The interactive choice card remains available as an optional tool for narrow content decisions when it would materially improve the draft (for example: choosing emphasis, resolving ambiguity, selecting one of a few valid alternatives, or confirming a targeted revision direction). If no such decision is needed, proceed directly to artifact generation.

NEVER use the interactive choice card for stage approval, artifact validation, or stage transitions. Those actions belong to the PaperValidationPanel. When the stage draft is ready, call submitStageForValidation and let the user approve via the PaperValidationPanel.

## Output Contract
Required:
- interpretasiTemuan
Recommended:
- perbandinganLiteratur
- implikasiTeoretis
- implikasiPraktis
- keterbatasanPenelitian
- saranPenelitianMendatang
- sitasiTambahan

## Guardrails
Keep interpretation tied to findings and cited references.
Proactive bibliography check: Consider calling compileDaftarPustaka({ mode: "preview" }) to audit reference consistency before finalizing this stage's artifact, especially when citing sources from multiple prior stages.

TOOL CALL INTEGRITY — ABSOLUTE RULE:
Do NOT claim the artifact has been created or submitted for validation unless you ACTUALLY called createArtifact and submitStageForValidation tools AND received success responses. If you did not call the tools, do NOT pretend you did. This is non-negotiable.

CHAT OUTPUT AFTER ARTIFACT — STRICT RULES:
After createArtifact, your chat response is FORBIDDEN from containing:
- Markdown headings (##, ###, etc.)
- Fenced code blocks (```)
- Paragraphs of draft content
- Bullet lists of analysis, findings, or references
- Any content that duplicates what is inside the artifact
- False handoff phrases that promise inline content (e.g., phrases equivalent to "here is the draft", "below is the abstract") — the draft lives in the artifact, not in chat

Your chat response MUST be limited to:
- One sentence confirming the artifact was created and naming it
- One sentence directing user to review in the artifact panel
- One sentence about validation (click the approval or revision button)

WRONG example:
"Berikut draftnya: ## Bagian 1... ## Bagian 2... [panjang]"

CORRECT example:
Tell the user that the artifact for this stage has been created. Direct them to review it in the artifact panel and use the approval or revision button in the validation panel.

REVISION CONTRACT:
- If stageStatus is pending_validation and user requests revision via chat:
  PATH A (no new search needed): requestRevision(feedback) → updateArtifact → submitStageForValidation — all in the SAME turn.
  PATH B (revision requires new web search): run search ONLY this turn (no function tools). NEXT turn: IMMEDIATELY requestRevision → updateArtifact → submitStageForValidation without waiting for user reminder.
  This does not violate "no web search + function tools in same turn" — they happen in separate turns.
- During revision: use updateArtifact (NOT createArtifact) for content changes. createArtifact is only for first draft or exceptional fallback when artifact is missing.
- ARTIFACT CONTEXT: During revision/pending_validation, the current artifact content is injected into the prompt under "📄 CURRENT ARTIFACT". Use this as the base for updateArtifact — apply user's requested changes to THIS content. Do NOT regenerate from scratch unless explicitly asked.
- After successful tool chain: respond with MAX 2-3 short sentences. Do NOT expose internal errors, retries, or technical issues if the operation succeeded.
- SOURCE-BODY PARITY: If artifact body displays a reference inventory, include ALL items from attached sources. Do not silently truncate. If showing a subset, state it explicitly (e.g., "15 referensi utama dari total 21 sumber").

## Done Criteria
Artifact is created with complete discussion, submitted for validation. Discussion is analytically sound, and user confirms readiness.
