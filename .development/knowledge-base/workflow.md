# 8-phase workflow with respect to LLM's model intelligence and behavior (regulated in `system prompt`)

## Phase 1: Brainstorming (Academic Agent with Research Context)

**Phase Purpose:** Generating multiple topic options through AI-assisted exploration when user has no initial research idea, using grounded search and literature as inspiration catalysts.

**User Actions:** Users who have no research ideas yet engage with the Academic Agent in research context, providing only their academic field, interests, or general institutional context. They review AI-generated topic options and select promising directions for further clarification.

**AI Actions:** The Academic Agent with research context performs exploratory topic generation using grounded web search and preliminary literature discovery as inspiration catalysts. The system asks probing questions like "Has this topic been discussed before?" or "What if we explore this topic based on this reference?", generates multiple viable research topic options, and presents them to the user for consideration. This phase focuses on creative exploration rather than commitment.

**Tools**: Model/agent uses grounded `web search` for idea exploration and preliminary literature discovery as inspiration catalysts (examples: "Has this topic been discussed before?" or "What if we explore this topic based on this reference?").

## Phase 2: Topic Clarification (Academic Agent with Research Context)

**Phase Purpose:** Selecting and refining one definitive topic from brainstormed options through focused academic clarification dialogue.

**User Actions:** Users indicate their preferred topic from Phase 1 options and engage in iterative refinement dialogue with the Academic Agent to sharpen scope, validate feasibility, and finalize the definitive research topic.

**AI Actions:** The Academic Agent with research context refines the selected topic to definitive clarity, applies academic methodology guidance to ensure topic viability, suggests scope refinements based on academic standards, validates topic uniqueness and contribution potential, and generates the finalized definitive topic statement ready for research foundation building.

**Tools**: Model/agent can use `web search` for validation and clarification of the selected topic.

## Phase 3: Research Foundation (Academic Agent with Research Context)

**Phase Purpose:** Academic source discovery, credibility validation, knowledge synthesis, and comprehensive research methodology establishment to build research foundation. 

**User Actions:** Users review AI-discovered academic sources, validate research materials against their institutional requirements, provide feedback on source relevance and quality, and approve the comprehensive research foundation and methodology that will inform their academic work.

**AI Actions:** The Academic Agent with research context conducts systematic academic source discovery, applies credibility assessment methodologies, synthesizes knowledge from validated sources, identifies research gaps and opportunities, develops comprehensive research methodology, and generates structured research foundation documentation with properly formatted citations and source analysis.

**Tools**: During Research Foundation establishment, model/agent uses `web search` for information updates and advanced literature discovery. Agent/model deepens references/literature obtained from the first and second phases, then expands search and exploration for comprehensive research foundation and methodology development.

## Phase 4: Structure Planning (Academic Agent with Writing Context)

**Phase Purpose:** Academic outline generation and argument flow optimization through AI-assisted structural planning.

**User Actions:** Users collaborate with the Academic Agent with writing context to develop comprehensive paper structure, review argument progression logic, validate section organization against academic standards, and approve the detailed outline that will guide content creation.

**AI Actions:** The Academic Agent with writing context analyzes research foundation materials, generates academic paper outlines following disciplinary conventions, optimizes argument flow and logical progression, ensures structural compliance with institutional requirements, and creates detailed section specifications with clear academic objectives.

## Phase 5: Content Creation (Academic Agent with Writing Context)

**Phase Purpose:** Section-by-section academic prose generation with style guide compliance and quality validation.

**User Actions:** Users engage in collaborative content creation, reviewing AI-generated academic sections, providing feedback on style and content quality, validating citations and academic formatting, and approving sections individually to maintain quality control throughout the writing process.

**AI Actions:** The Academic Agent with writing context generates distinguished academic prose for each paper section, ensures style guide compliance and formatting accuracy, integrates research foundation materials appropriately, maintains consistent academic voice and argument development, and provides comprehensive citation management and reference formatting.

## Phase 6: Document Integration (Academic Agent with Writing Context)

**Phase Purpose:** Document harmonization and coherence optimization to create unified academic manuscript.

**User Actions:** Users review the integrated academic manuscript, assess document coherence and flow, validate style consistency across sections, and approve the complete first draft that demonstrates unified academic narrative and argument development.

**AI Actions:** The Academic Agent with writing context harmonizes all content sections into a coherent academic document, ensures consistent voice and style throughout the manuscript, optimizes transitions and flow between sections, validates citation consistency and formatting, and generates a complete integrated draft with comprehensive quality assessment.

## Phase 7: Final Polish (Academic Agent with Review Context)

**Phase Purpose:** Comprehensive quality validation and academic compliance verification for publication readiness.

**User Actions:** Users participate in final quality assessment, review publication readiness evaluation, validate academic compliance with institutional requirements, and approve the final academic paper that meets the highest standards of scholarly excellence.

**AI Actions:** The Academic Agent with review context conducts comprehensive quality validation across multiple dimensions, verifies academic compliance with institutional and disciplinary standards, performs publication readiness assessment, identifies final improvement opportunities, and generates the final academic paper with complete quality certification.

## Phase 8: Delivery (Academic Agent with Review Context)

**Phase Purpose:** Audit trail generation and academic accountability documentation for complete project delivery.

**User Actions:** Users acknowledge receipt of the complete academic package, review the comprehensive audit trail documenting all collaboration activities, validate academic integrity documentation, and confirm satisfaction with the delivered scholarly work and process transparency.

**AI Actions:** The Academic Agent with review context generates comprehensive audit trail documentation, creates academic accountability records, compiles complete project deliverables, ensures academic integrity verification, and provides complete academic package with full transparency and documentation.

**Quality Control:** Users acknowledge the complete academic delivery, review accountability documentation, and confirm academic integrity satisfaction. This represents the final stage of the collaborative academic process with complete transparency and audit trail provision.
